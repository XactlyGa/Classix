Extract the files you have downloaded.

Details: Click on the "Download" button, save the zip 
somewhere on your hard disk, g
o to the place where it is saved, double-click on the
 zip to open it, then either click on 
"Extract all files" or drag and drop the files elsewhere 
from the zip window (hold down the 
CTRL key to select several files at once)
For the 20th century versions of Windows you must install 
an unzip tool first.

    Under Windows 8/7/Vista
    Select the font files (.ttf, .otf or .fon) then 
Right-click > Install

    Under any version of Windows
    Place the font files (.ttf, .otf or .fon) into the 
Fonts folder, usually C:\Windows\Fonts or C:\WINNT\Fonts
    (can be reached as well by the Start Menu > Control Panel > 
Appearance and Themes > Fonts).

    Note that with the internal unzip tool of Windows (unlike Winzip),
 you cannot install a font by a simple drag 
and drop of the .ttf from the zip window to the Fonts window. You must 
first drag and drop it anywhere (for example 
on the desktop) then into the Fonts folder.
    You can also go through: File > Install a new font... in the Fonts 
folder menu then browse the fonts, instead 
of drag and drop the fonts into the window. Although this method is 
laborious, it would seem that it functions better in some cases.
